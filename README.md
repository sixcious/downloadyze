## Important Note
Downloadyze is currently in beta. Unfortunately, this means it might contain a few bugs and it might not work on every website you try it on! But I really want you to be 100% happy with it, so if something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please feel free to open an issue me and give me a chance to fix it and I promise I will.

## Permissions Justification
- `Read and change all your data on the websites you visit` - Downloadyze needs to request this permission so that it can download files from multiple pages automatically (essentially, so it can run its content script automatically on the pages you want it to).
- `Manage your downloads` - Downloadyze needs to request this permission so it can download files.
